# How to Deploy Your Personal Website Using GitHub Pages

## Prerequisites
1. **Create a New GitHub Account**
   - If you don't already have a GitHub account, go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up for a new account.

2. **Add a New Repository**
   - After creating your account, log in and click on the “New” button to create a new repository.
   - Give your repository a name, make sure it is public, and then click “Create repository.”

3. **Upload Your HTML Page to the Repository**
   - Once the repository is created, you’ll be taken to its main page. Click the “Add file” button, then “Upload files.”
   - Select your HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) from your computer and upload it. Make sure the file is named `index.html` as this will be the default page for your site.
   - Commit the changes to the repository.

4. **Deploy Your Website**
   - Go to the “Settings” tab of your repository.
   - Scroll down to the “GitHub Pages” section.
   - Under “Source,” select the branch that contains your HTML file (usually `main` or `master`), then click “Save.”
   - After a few moments, you’ll see a message with the URL where your site is published (it will be something like `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repository-name`).

By following these steps, you will have successfully deployed your personal website using GitHub Pages. Happy coding!
